# ChatGPT-Codex Exchange Protocol v1

## Actors
- `chatgpt`
- `codex`

## Required status markers
Each active file must contain one status marker line:
- `status: draft`
- `status: ready-for-codex`
- `status: in-review-by-codex`
- `status: ready-for-chatgpt`
- `status: ready-for-owner`
- `status: closed`

## Handshake order
1. ChatGPT starts with `exchange/chatgpt/audit_basis/current_audit_basis_v1.md`
2. ChatGPT sets `status: ready-for-codex`
3. Codex reviews/evaluates and writes next request/response artifact if needed
4. Codex updates stream with actor and status transition
5. for decision rounds, both sides provide agreement scores and Codex derives owner decision draft
6. Codex publishes one human-readable owner packet in `exchange/chatgpt/outbox/*__owner_decision_packet_v1.md`

## Channel separation (required)
- Internal ChatGPT↔Codex exchange artifacts may be compact or machine-oriented.
- Owner-facing packet must remain human-readable and decision-ready.
- Owner packet is the only mandatory readable handoff object for decisioning.

## Stream entry requirement
Every stream entry must include:
- actor (`chatgpt` or `codex`)
- source file
- resulting status
